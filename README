This is a snake game which starts off pretty slow. But every fifth food spawn is a big spawn which will increase the speed of the snake when eaten. But the big food only stays on the map for a certain amount of time and after that is replaced by a new, small spawn.
The benefit of a faster snake is that you get more points for each food eaten.

Control the snake with the arrow keys.
Press ESCAPE to quit your current game and return to the menu.
Press 'P' to pause the game.
